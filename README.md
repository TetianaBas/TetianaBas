👋 Hello! I'm Tetiana Bas, a passionate Data Science and Machine Learning enthusiast based in San Francisco, CA. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree at Minerva University, with a double major in Data Science/Machine Learning and Economics with an expected graduation in 2025.

📚 My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. I've had the opportunity to apply my classroom knowledge to real-world scenarios, working with local communities across multiple countries, including the USA, Taiwan, South Korea, and India.

🌟 Key Skills:

Machine Learning: I have hands-on experience in developing and implementing ML models, working with various algorithms and frameworks such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. I utilize tools like Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab for model development and experimentation.

Data Analysis: Proficient in exploring, cleaning, and visualizing data using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. I also employ tools like Seaborn and Plotly to create insightful data visualizations.

Programming: I'm skilled in Python, R, and SQL, enabling me to build robust applications and tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Statistics: I have a solid understanding of statistical concepts and their applications in data-driven decision-making, including hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and probability distributions. I've used tools like SciPy for statistical computations.

🌎 Multilingual: I'm fluent in multiple languages, including Ukrainian, Russian, English, Spanish, French, and Polish.

🤝 I'm open to internships and collaborations on interesting and challenging data science and machine learning projects. Feel free to reach out to me at tetianabass17@gmail.com to connect and explore potential opportunities.

Let's innovate, learn, and build together!
